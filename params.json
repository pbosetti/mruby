{"body":"# !!Notice!!\r\n    This is a preliminary release for internal team review.\r\n    The URLs and addresses described below are not available yet.\r\n    The official release will be announced later.\r\n    Any suggestion for modification is welcome.\r\n    Delays in replies are to be expected. Sorry in advance.\r\n\r\n## What's mruby\r\n\r\nmruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part of)\r\nthe [ISO standard](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579). \r\nmruby can be linked and embedded within your application.  We provide the interpreter program \"mruby\" and \r\nthe interactive mruby shell \"mirb\" as examples.  You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code\r\nusing the mruby compiler \"mrbc\".  All those tools reside in \"bin\" directory.  The \"mrbc\" is also able to\r\ngenerate compiled byte code in a C source file.  You can check the \"mrbtest\" program under the \"test\" directory.\r\n\r\nThis achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&D Programs of\r\nthe Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to get mruby\r\n\r\nThe mruby distribution files can be found in the following site:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the mruby source tree can be checked out with the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby.git\r\n\r\nThere are some other branches under development. Try the following\r\ncommand and see the list of branches:\r\n\r\n    $ git branch -r\r\n\r\n\r\n## mruby home-page\r\n\r\nmruby's website is not launched yet but we are actively working on it.\r\n\r\nThe URL of the mruby home-page will be:\r\n\r\n  http://www.mruby.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mailing list\r\n\r\nTo subscribe to the mruby mailing list....[T.B.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to compile and install\r\n\r\nSee the INSTALL file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 mruby developers\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a \r\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), \r\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation \r\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, \r\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the \r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in \r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR \r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Doing so for big projects can be \r\ncomplicated or troublesome.\r\nThis is why mruby has decided to display \"mruby developers\" as the copyright name\r\nto make it simple conventionally.\r\nIn the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code\r\n(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of\r\n\"mruby developers\" but contributors will keep their copyright.\r\n(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,\r\n Actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the AUTHORS file.)\r\n\r\nPlease ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.\r\n\r\n## How to Contribute\r\n\r\nSend pull request to <http://github.com/mruby/mruby>.   We consider you have granted\r\nnon-exclusive right to your contributed code under MIT license.  If you want to be named\r\nas one of mruby developers, include update to the AUTHORS file in your pull request.\r\n","tagline":"Lightweight Ruby","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
