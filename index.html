<h2>What's mruby</h2>

<p>mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part of)
the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579">ISO standard</a>. 
mruby can be linked and embedded within your application.  We provide the interpreter program "mruby" and 
the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples.  You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code
using the mruby compiler "mrbc".  All those tools reside in "bin" directory.  The "mrbc" is also able to
generate compiled byte code in a C source file.  You can check the "mrbtest" program under the "test" directory.</p>

<p>This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&amp;D Programs of
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.</p>

<h2>Note for License</h2>

<p>mruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing
developers to target various environments such as embedded systems.
However, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license
information in manuals for instance. Doing so for big projects can be 
complicated or troublesome.
This is why mruby has decided to display "mruby developers" as the copyright name
to make it simple conventionally.
In the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code
(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of
"mruby developers" but contributors will keep their copyright.
(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,
 Actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the AUTHORS file.)</p>

<p>Please ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>

<p>Send pull request to <a href="http://github.com/mruby/mruby">http://github.com/mruby/mruby</a>.   We consider you have granted
non-exclusive right to your contributed code under MIT license.  If you want to be named
as one of mruby developers, include update to the AUTHORS file in your pull request.</p>
